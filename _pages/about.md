Hi! I am Zhiheng (James), and I am studying at UCLA as a Computer Science and Engineering major. I am particularly interested in research and machine learning. Currently, I am working at the Structures-Computer Interaction Lab at UCLA, on the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Robotics.

I am currently working towards a publication on using LLMs to develop physically realistic simulations based on robotic data.
