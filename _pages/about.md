Hi! I am Zhiheng (James), and I am studying at UCLA as a Computer Science and Engineering major. I am particularly interested in research and machine learning. Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the Computational Machine Learning Lab at UCLA, working on Large Language Model compression. Previously, I have also worked on Physical AI, Robotics and Reinforcement Learning, as well as Complex Systems.

I am currently seeking opportunities for Summer 2026, feel free to reach out!
