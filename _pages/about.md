Hi! I am Zhiheng (James) from Singapore, and I will be studying at UCLA as a Computer Science and Engineering major, from Fall 2024 onwards. I am particularly interested in research and machine learning, and I have won multiple awards in AI and robotics challenges in Singapore. I also enjoy writing, and have published several articles on Medium and TowardsDataScience documenting my coding journey so far.

I am looking forward to studying in Los Angeles, and travelling around in the United States in the upcoming year.
