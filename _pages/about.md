Hi! I am Zhiheng (James), and I am studying at UCLA as a Computer Science and Engineering major. I am particularly interested in research and machine learning, particularly in LLMs, Physical AI and Robotics.

During my freshman year, I worked at the Structures-Computer Interaction Lab at UCLA, on the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Robotics and Simulation, where I worked on a publication on using LLMs to develop physically realistic reduced-order beam simulations using 3D Discrete Elastic Rod simulation data and physically-informed neural networks.

Currently, I am working at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, working on Scenario Generation using LLMs for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).
