Hi! I am Zhiheng (James), and I am studying at UCLA as a Computer Science and Engineering major. I am particularly interested in research and machine learning, particularly in Reinforcement Learning, LLMs, Physical AI and Robotics.

During my freshman year, I worked at the Structures-Computer Interaction Lab at UCLA, on the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Robotics and Simulation, where I worked on a publication on using LLMs to develop physically realistic reduced-order beam simulations using 3D Discrete Elastic Rod simulation data and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

Currently, I am working at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, in the Human-inspired Adaptive Teaming Systems (HATS) lab, working on Preference-Driven Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (PD-MORL) with Graph Neural Networks.
