Our team set out to develop optimal groupings for our classmates so that our classmates could work with matching personalities. We investigated whether our classmates enjoyed working with similar, different or a mixed group of personalities by surveying them on a variety of groupings generated by our Genetic Algorithm in C++, based off the MBTI personality test data collected from our classmates.
